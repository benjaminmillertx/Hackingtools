 To create an advanced Java tool for data aggregation, you can use various techniques and technologies to combine and analyze related data bits from different sources. Here is an outline of the steps you can follow to create an advanced Java tool for data aggregation:

1. **Identify the sources of the data**: It is important to identify the sources of the data that you want to aggregate. This may include databases, APIs, web services, and other data sources.
2. **Connect to the data sources**: After you have identified the data sources, you will need to connect to them and retrieve the data. This may involve using database drivers, HTTP clients, and other tools and techniques.
3. **Parse and clean the data**: Once you have retrieved the data, you will need to parse and clean it to ensure that it is in a consistent and usable format. This may involve using data parsing libraries, data cleaning tools, and other techniques.
4. **Transform the data**: After you have parsed and cleaned the data, you will need to transform it into a format that is suitable for aggregation. This may involve using data transformation libraries, data mapping tools, and other techniques.
5. **Aggregate the data**: Once you have transformed the data, you can use various techniques and algorithms to combine it and identify patterns and connections. This may involve using data aggregation libraries, data mining tools, and other techniques.
6. **Visualize the data**: After you have aggregated the data, you will need to visualize it in a way that is easy to understand and consume. This may involve using data visualization libraries, charting tools, and other techniques.

Here is an example of how you can use Java to implement a data aggregation tool:

```
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class DataAggregator {

  // Aggregate data from a database and a web service
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Connect to the database
    String dbUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/example";
    String dbUser = "user";
    String dbPassword = "password";
    Connection dbConnection = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl, dbUser, dbPassword);
    Statement dbStatement = dbConnection.createStatement();
    ResultSet dbResultSet = dbStatement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM example");

    // Set up a map to store the aggregated data
    Map<Integer, Integer> data = new HashMap<>();

    // Loop through the database result set and add the data to the map
    while (dbResultSet.next()) {
      int id = dbResultSet.getInt("id");
      int value = dbResultSet.getInt("value");
      data.put(id, data.getOrDefault(id, 0) + value);
    }

    // Connect to the web service
    URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/webservice");
    HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
    urlConnection.setRequestMethod("GET");
    urlConnection.connect();

    // Read the response from the web service
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(urlConnection.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
      builder.append(line);
    }
    reader.close();

    // Parse the response from the web service
    JSONObject json = new JSONObject(builder.toString());
    JSONArray jsonArray = json.getJSONArray("data");

    // Loop through the JSON array and add the data to the map
    for (int i = 0; i < jsonArray.length(); i++) {
      JSONObject jsonObject = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);
      int id = jsonObject.getInt("id");
      int value = jsonObject.getInt("value");
      data.put(id, data.getOrDefault(id, 0) + value);
    }

    // Close the database and web service connections
    dbResultSet.close();
    dbStatement.close();
    dbConnection.close();
    urlConnection.disconnect();

    // Print the aggregated data
    for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : data.entrySet()) {
      System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
    }
  }
}
```

This Java tool uses a database and a web service to collect data, and then aggregates and visualizes the data in a simple format.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and there are many other ways to implement a data aggregation tool in Java. Depending on your specific needs, you may want to consider using other classes and libraries, such as the `java.net` package or the `org.apache.httpcomponents` library.

It is also important to note that data aggregation can be a complex and time-consuming task, and it may require the use of multiple tools and techniques. It is generally recommended to start with the simplest tools and techniques, and then move on to more advanced tools as needed.
