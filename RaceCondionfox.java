Sure, here's a program that demonstrates how to create a race condition checker.
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class RaceConditionChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int numThreads = 10;
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numThreads);
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
            final int threadNum = i;
            executor.execute(() -> {
                try {
                    // Perform some operation that may result in a race condition
                    if (isRaceCondition(threadNum)) {
                        System.out.println("Race condition detected in thread " + threadNum);
                    }
                } finally {
                    latch.countDown();
                }
            });
        }

        latch.await();
        executor.shutdown();
    }

    private static boolean isRaceCondition(int threadNum) {
        // Check for a race condition based on the thread number
        // This is just a simple example, you should replace it with your own logic
        if (threadNum % 2 == 0) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
This code creates a fixed thread pool with a specified number of threads, and each thread performs an operation that may result in a race condition. The CountDownLatch is used to wait for all threads to complete their execution before shutting down the executor.
The isRaceCondition method is a simple example that checks if the thread number is even. In a real-world scenario, you should replace this with your own logic to detect a race condition.
