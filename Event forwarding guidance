To implement the collection of security-relevant Windows Event Log events using Windows Event Forwarding (WEF), follow these steps:

1. Set Up the WEF Infrastructure

a. Identify the Collectors and Forwarders:

	•	Collectors are systems that receive events from other systems.
	•	Forwarders are the systems that send events to the collectors.

b. Configure Group Policy for Forwarding:

	•	Create a Group Policy Object (GPO) to configure event forwarding on the forwarders.

2. Configure the Event Collector (Windows Server)

a. Enable the Windows Event Collector Service:

	•	Open Services and start the Windows Event Collector service.
	•	Set the startup type to Automatic.

b. Configure the Collector for Network Traffic:

	•	Run wecutil qc in an elevated Command Prompt. This command sets up the collector for incoming event subscriptions.

3. Configure the Event Forwarder (Client Systems)

a. Enable the Windows Remote Management Service:

	•	Open Services and start the Windows Remote Management (WS-Management) service.
	•	Set the startup type to Automatic.

b. Configure the Client to Trust the Collector:

	•	Run winrm quickconfig in an elevated Command Prompt.
	•	Run winrm set winrm/config/client @{TrustedHosts="collector_hostname"} to add the collector to the trusted hosts list.

4. Create a Subscription on the Collector

a. Open Event Viewer on the Collector:

	•	Navigate to Subscriptions and click Create Subscription.

b. Configure the Subscription:

	•	Subscription Name: Name your subscription (e.g., “Security Event Forwarding”).
	•	Description: Provide a description.
	•	Destination Log: Specify the log where events will be stored (e.g., Forwarded Events).

c. Configure Source Computers:

	•	Click Add and specify the computers that will forward events.
	•	Select the Collector Initiated option to manually specify computers or groups.

d. Configure the Event Filters:

	•	Click Select Events… and specify the event logs and event IDs you want to collect (e.g., Security log, 4624 for logon events).

5. Deploy Group Policy to Forwarders

a. Create a New Group Policy Object (GPO):

	•	Open Group Policy Management and create a new GPO linked to the organizational unit (OU) containing the forwarders.

b. Configure the GPO:

	•	Navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Event Forwarding.

c. Configure the Forwarding Policy:

	•	Enable the Configure target Subscription Manager setting and specify the collector’s URL in the format: Server=http://collector_hostname:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC.

6. Verify and Monitor Event Collection

a. Verify Forwarding:

	•	Check the Forwarded Events log on the collector to ensure events are being received.

b. Monitor and Troubleshoot:

	•	Regularly monitor the event logs for any issues.
	•	Use tools like Event Viewer, wecutil, and winrm for troubleshooting.

Additional Tips

	•	Security: Ensure that communication between forwarders and collectors is secure, using HTTPS if necessary.
	•	Filtering: Refine your event filters to minimize noise and focus on critical events.
	•	Documentation: Keep thorough documentation of your configuration for future reference and audits.

This configuration will help you effectively collect and centralize security-relevant Windows Event Log events using Windows Event Forwarding.
