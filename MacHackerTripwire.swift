 Make sure to credit Benjamin Hunter Miller.To create a system that sends an email alert when a specific text file is accessed on a Windows system, you can use a combination of tools such as PowerShell, Task Scheduler, and a mail client. Here's a basic example:

1. Create a PowerShell script that sends an email when the file is accessed:

Create a PowerShell script called `file_alert.ps1` with the following content:

```powershell
$FILE_PATH = "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"
$EMAIL = "your_email@example.com"

if (Test-Path $FILE_PATH) {
    $watcher = New-Object System.IO.FileSystemWatcher
    $watcher.Path = $FILE_PATH
    $watcher.Filter = "file.txt"
    $watcher.NotifyFilter = [System.IO.NotifyFilters]'FileName, LastWrite'
    $watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = $true

    Register-ObjectEvent -InputObject $watcher -EventName "Created" -Action {
        $emailParams = @{
            From       = $EMAIL
            To         = $EMAIL
            Subject    = "File Access Alert"
            Body       = "File $FILE_PATH has been accessed"
            SmtpServer = "smtp.example.com"
            Port       = 587
            Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($EMAIL, (ConvertTo-SecureString "your_password" -AsPlainText -Force))
        }

        Send-MailMessage @emailParams
    }
}
```

Replace `C:\path\to\your\file.txt` with the path to the file you want to monitor, and `your_email@example.com` with the email address where you want to receive the alerts. Replace `smtp.example.com` and `your_password` with the appropriate values for your mail server.

2. Make the script executable:

You need to allow PowerShell scripts to run on your system. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

3. Create a scheduled task to run the script periodically:

Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter. In the Task Scheduler window, click on `Create Task` under the `Actions` panel. In the `General` tab, enter a name for the task, and select `Run whether user is logged on or not` and `Run with highest privileges`. In the `Triggers` tab, add a new trigger with the following settings:

* Begin the task: `On a schedule`
* Settings: `Daily`, `Recur every 1 day`, `At`, and select the time you want the task to run

In the `Actions` tab, add a new action with the following settings:

* Action: `Start a program`
* Program/script: `powershell.exe`
* Add arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\your\file_alert.ps1"`

Replace `C:\path\to\your\file_alert.ps1` with the path to the `file_alert.ps1` script.

4. Test the script:

To test the script, open
