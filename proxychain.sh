Make sure to credit Benjamin Hunter Miller. Here are the steps to create a Linux proxy chain using tor or ssh:
Install tor or ssh client:
For tor, you can install it using the package manager of your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:
sudo apt-get install tor
For ssh, you can use the built-in ssh client.
Set up the proxy chain:
For tor, you can use the following command to set up a proxy chain:
torify -p 9050 your-command
Replace your-command with the command you want to run through the tor proxy. The default tor proxy listening port is 9050.
For ssh, you can use the following command to set up a proxy chain:
ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q user@proxy-host" user@destination-host
Replace user@proxy-host with the user and hostname or IP address of the intermediate proxy server, and user@destination-host with the user and hostname or IP address of the final destination host.
Test the proxy chain:
To test the proxy chain, you can use a tool like curl to make an HTTP request through the proxy. For example, to make an HTTP request through tor, you can run:
torify curl https://www.example.com
To make an HTTP request through ssh, you can run:
ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q user@proxy-host" user@destination-host curl https://www.example.com
Note that these are just basic examples of how to set up a proxy chain using tor or ssh. The actual configuration will depend on your specific network and security requirements. It's always a good idea to consult the official documentation for tor and ssh and seek advice from experienced system administrators or security professionals.
