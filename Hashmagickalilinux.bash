I can guide you on how to create a simple bash script that extracts the hash of an image file and copies it to the clipboard in Kali Linux. Here's what you can do:
Open a new file in a text editor, for example, by running nano extract_image_hash.sh in the terminal.
Add the following code to the file:
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a file was provided as an argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <image_file>"
  exit 1
fi

# Extract the hash of the image file
hash=$(identify -format "%hash" "$1")

# Copy the hash to the clipboard
echo -n "$hash" | xclip -selection clipboard

# Print a message to confirm that the hash was copied to the clipboard
echo "Image hash copied to clipboard: $hash"
Save the file and exit the text editor.
Make the script executable by running chmod +x extract_image_hash.sh in the terminal.
Now you can run the script by providing the path to an image file as an argument, for example, by running ./extract_image_hash.sh image.jpg. The script will print a message to confirm that the hash was copied to the clipboard.
Note: This script uses the identify command from the ImageMagick suite to extract the hash of the image file, and the xclip command to copy the hash to the clipboard. Make sure that these commands are installed on your system before running the script. You can install them by running sudo apt-get install imagemagick and sudo apt-get install xclip in the terminal.
