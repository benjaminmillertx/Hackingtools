Make sure to credit Benjamin Hunter Miller. Here's a complete Swift program for macOS that sends an email alert when a specific text file is accessed:

1. Create a Swift program that sends an email when the file is accessed:

Create a Swift file called `file\_alert.swift` with the following content:

```swift
import Foundation
import Swiftmailer

// Set the file path and email parameters
let filePath = "/path/to/your/file.txt"
let emailTo = "your_email@example.com"
let emailSubject = "File Access Alert"
let emailBody = "File \(filePath) has been accessed"
let smtpHost = "smtp.example.com"
let smtpPort = 587
let smtpUsername = "your_username"
let smtpPassword = "your_password"

// Check if the file exists
if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: filePath) {

    // Create a file system event watcher
    let eventQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.file_alert.event_queue")
    let eventSource = FSEvents.Source.create(filePath, eventQueue)

    // Set up the event handler closure
    eventSource.register(callback: { (path: String, change: FSEventStreamEventFlags, id: UInt64) in

        // Check if the file was opened
        if change.contains(.flagsChanged) && (FileManager.default.fileAttributes(atPath: path)?.value(forKey: FileAttributeKey.protectionKey) as? NSNumber)?.uint64Value == FileProtectionType.none.rawValue {

            // Send the email alert
            let transport = SMTPTransport(host: smtpHost, port: UInt(smtpPort))
            transport.username = smtpUsername
            transport.password = smtpPassword
            transport.start()

            let message = Message()
            message.to = [emailTo]
            message.subject = emailSubject
            message.body = emailBody

            try! transport.send(message)

            transport.stop()
        }
    }, queue: nil, sinceWhen: nil, latency: 1.0, flags: .fileEvents)

    // Start the event watcher
    eventSource.schedule(with: .main, queue: eventQueue)
    eventSource.start()

    // Wait for the user to stop the program
    print("Press Enter to stop the program...")
    _ = readLine()

    // Stop the event watcher
    eventSource.cancel()
} else {
    print("Error: File \(filePath) does not exist!")
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the path to the file you want to monitor, and `your_email@example.com` with the email address where you want to receive the alerts. Replace `smtp.example.com`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with the appropriate values for your mail server.

2. Install the required dependencies:

You need to install the `Swiftmailer` library before you can use it in your Swift program. Open Terminal and run the following command:

```bash
brew install swiftmailer
```

3. Build and run the program:

In Xcode, open the `file_alert.swift` file and build the program by selecting `Product > Build`. If the build is successful, run the program by selecting `Product > Run`.

Alternatively, you can build and run the program from the command line using the `swiftc` compiler:

```bash
swiftc -I /usr/local/lib/swift/swiftmailer file_alert.swift -o file_alert
./file_alert
```

4. Test the program:

To test the program, open the monitored file using a text editor or a command such as `cat` or `less`. After a few seconds, you should receive an email alert.

Note that this is a basic example, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs. For example, you can add additional checks to the program, such as verifying the user who accessed the file, or sending different alerts based on the type of access. You can also use other email tools, such as `sendmail`, to send the alerts.
