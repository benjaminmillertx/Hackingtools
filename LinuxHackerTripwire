Make sure to credit Benjamin Hunter Miller. more_vert To create a system that sends an email alert when a specific text file is accessed on a Linux system, you can use a combination of tools such as inotify, mail, and cron. Here's a basic example:
Install the inotify-tools package:
You can install inotify-tools on Ubuntu using the following command:
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
Create a script that sends an email when the file is accessed:
Create a script called file_alert.sh with the following content:
#!/bin/bash

FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/file.txt"
EMAIL="your_email@example.com"

if [ -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
  inotifywait -e open "$FILE_PATH" --format '%w%f' | while read FILE
  do
    echo "File $FILE has been accessed" | mail -s "File Access Alert" $EMAIL
  done
fi
Replace /path/to/your/file.txt with the path to the file you want to monitor, and your_email@example.com with the email address where you want to receive the alerts.
Make the script executable:
chmod +x file_alert.sh
Schedule the script to run periodically:
You can use cron to run the script every minute. Edit the crontab file using the following command:
crontab -e
Add the following line to the file:
* * * * * /path/to/your/file_alert.sh
Replace /path/to/your/file_alert.sh with the path to the file_alert.sh script.
Test the script:
To test the script, open the monitored file using a text editor or a command such as cat or less. After a few seconds, you should receive an email alert.
Note that this is a basic example, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs. For example, you can add additional checks to the script, such as verifying the user who accessed the file, or sending different alerts based on the type of access. You can also use other email tools, such as sendmail, to send the alerts.
