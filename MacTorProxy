here are the steps to create a proxy chain using tor on a Mac:
Install tor:
You can download the latest version of tor for macOS from the official website (<https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html>). After downloading, extract the archive and move the Tor application to the /Applications directory.
Start tor:
Open the Terminal application and run the following command to start tor:
/Applications/Tor/Tor.app/Contents/MacOS/Tor
Check the tor status:
To check if tor is running and listening on the default port (9050), you can run:
lsof -i :9050
If tor is running, you should see a line like this:
Tor      12345 username   23u  IPv4 0x1234567890   0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:9050 (LISTEN)
Set up the tor proxy:
To set up the tor proxy, you can use the curl command with the --socks5 option and specify the localhost address and port (9050):
curl --socks5 localhost:9050 https://www.example.com
This command sends the HTTP request through the tor proxy to the specified destination.
Test the tor proxy chain:
To test the tor proxy chain, you can use the curl command with the --socks5 option and specify the localhost address and port (9050), and then specify the destination hostname or IP address:
ssh -o ProxyCommand="curl --socks5 localhost:9050 -sSf -m 30 -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:8080/%h:%p/" user@destination-host
Replace user with your username on the destination host, and destination-host with the hostname or IP address of the final destination host.
This command sends the SSH request through the tor proxy to the specified destination. The ProxyCommand option specifies the curl command with the --socks5 option and the localhost address and port (9050), and then specifies the destination hostname or IP address and port (8080). The -m option specifies the maximum time to wait for the connection (30 seconds). The -o option specifies the output file (/dev/null), and the -w option specifies the output format (%{http_code}), which prints the HTTP response code.
Note that this example uses ssh as the final proxy server, but you can also use other proxy servers such as a SOCKS proxy server. The actual configuration will depend on your specific network and security requirements. It's always a good idea to consult the official documentation for tor and seek advice from experienced system administrators or security professionals.
